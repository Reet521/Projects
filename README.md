## ‚öôÔ∏è **1. Fuzzy Logic in Automatic Braking Systems**
**Role**: Academic Project  
**Duration**: March 2024 - April 2024  
**Technologies**: Fuzzy Logic, Mamdani Inference System

### Overview:
In this academic project, I developed and optimized a fuzzy logic-based automatic braking system. The project involved using Mamdani fuzzy inference and analyzing test data to improve braking performance in vehicles.

### Key Contributions:
- Modeled and optimized the braking system using 28 rule base fuzzy logic.
- Achieved a deceleration value of 49.22 cm/s¬≤ at a speed of 63 cm/sec.
- Gained hands-on experience in fuzzy logic applications in automotive systems.
